# Introduction to Extractor

Extractor is a high-performance real-time capable alpha research platform with an easy interface for financial analytics.

It allows you to set up a computational graph that optimizes how your computations are executed.

You can use this component to structure your input data feeds and develop signals that can be used from the trading platform.

You could, for example, [build bars](BarsTutorial.md) from your BBO and trade feeds, or [generate signals](BarsTutorial.md#Signals_Tutorial) to make informed decisions based on any data feed that is relevant in your context.

You will be able to find more details about Extractor in the [extractor introduction](ExtractorIntroduction.md)

More information about Extractor's callback Python API is available in the [Extractor Python API](ExtractorPythonAPI.md) article.
